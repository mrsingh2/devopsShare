after updating the webhook you need to make some changes in one of your files in your github repo

then the Jenkins should trigger a build immeditately
from Jacob.mani1704 to All Participants:
on Github, under webhooks i can it is successful. But nothing in Github hook log??
from Bkarim60 to All Participants:
on the left hand side of the Jenkins home page there should be a 'github webhook log' link

can someone help how to add file in new public repo

"can someone help how to add file in new public repo" - in your githup repo , click one of the file and ther e should be a 'pencil' symbol next to 'history' button which stands for edit
from Bkarim60 to All Participants:
*one of your files
